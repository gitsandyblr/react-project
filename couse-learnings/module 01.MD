#Module 1 gives highlevel overview of different Javascript frameworks/libraries and about the course structure

##React
### Different elements in React 
To start with we need to import react and react-dom libraries. Version 16.X is the latest version of React.js
### JSX
In React.js we basically write JSX code and is similar to HTML code.
We usually use only one ReactDom.render() to render the components on page
### Javascript preprocessor
To compile React code we need to use a preprocessor which converts jsx into js code - For this Babel is used.


##Different frameworks/libraries - 
### Angular, React and Vue.js are the popular libraries currently - abstracts on implementation and focuses on logic.
### JQuery focuses more on implementation - is more oriented towards DOM structure and depends on the elements on DOM.

##SPA and Multipage applications
###SPA - Single Page Applications 
	- only one HTML page, content is rendered on client (Popular approach)
	- All components are react components. Even the root component is React component.
	- Tupically one ReactDom.render() call
###Multipage applications 
	- Multiple pages, content is rendered on server
	- Entire page is not under react's control and hence we might use multiple ReactDom.render() on the page.
